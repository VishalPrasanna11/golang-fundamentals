## About

This repository provides a collection of Go examples, exercises, and mini-projects designed to help you learn and practice Go. Topics range from the basics to more advanced concepts like concurrency and web server development. Each section includes code samples and explanations to make it easier to understand Go concepts in-depth.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Go Installation**  
   Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [Go's official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

```bash
go run <filename>.go
```

For example:

```bash
cd basics
go run hello_world.go
```
